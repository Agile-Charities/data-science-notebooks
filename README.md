This is where the Agile Charities class "Data Science in Python" will be storing and collaborating on in-class projects.

(edit: we corrupted a notebook)

Below are some of our workable project ideas:

### Water per capita

2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_renewable_water_resources

3. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population

### Data Challenges (public data sets)
